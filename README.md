# Road-Trip

Have you ever been planning a vacation and realized you really don't like planning?  If so you found the perfect app for you!  All you do is type in your destination city and we will grab 5 hotels, 5 restaurants, and 5 attractions for you to choose from!  If you REALLY don't want to plan and you just want the choice to be made for you... OR if you're on the 'adventurous' side, then click the SURPRISE button and we'll do the choosing for you!  Click the Trip Selection button at the bottom of the page to see a summary of your trip results.  You can start over with a new destination city, or look back at the other options we had for you.
